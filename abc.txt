Dear SOCIAL champions,

With Earth Day just around the corner, we are excited to invite you to participate in a special virtual volunteering activity focusing on herbal plants and home plants in collaboration with our Environment CSR NGO Partner, Give Me Trees Trust. This event aims to celebrate the beauty of nature and raise awareness about the importance of preserving our environment.
